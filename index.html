   <h2>How Music Transforms Life</h2>   
   <div id="imag"><img src="pops.jpg" ></div>
   <p class="awareness">
    You know every time you listen to music there is just one line that
    communicates to you.For me I would say music is life.Here is the
    reason as to why.Every musician has a strory behind their song and 
    for some they connect to what you have been through since some songs
    are  based on life experiences.I guess that is the reason you
     listen to a specified type of music rather than the other.
